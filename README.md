# Multiple-Health-Care-Prediction
The Multiple Health Care Predictor Web App is a revolutionary tool that can predict various health conditions such as Parkinson's disease, heart disease, breast cancer, and diabetes. It also has a feature to predict insurance costs for individuals.

## Discription
Our goal is to use the Streamlit integrated Python package to predict multiple diseases at once.  Before deployment, the dataset is trained with a more precise calculation. Python and Streamlit scanning is used to store the behaviour of the model while using machine learning techniques to perform various disease analyses. Using some basic parameters, such as pulse, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, etc., we analyze diabetes, heart disease and Parkinson's disease in this article. We can also find disease risk factors using predictive models with high accuracy and precision.  In addition, there are some additional chronic diseases, such as skin diseases. This study shows that many diseases can be predicted by basic health indicators alone. The aim of this study is to identify the most common diseases, screen those who have them, and provide early warning to patients to reduce mortality. Streamlit uses machine learning methods to perform various disease assessments. Heart, Parkinsons and diabetes are the three diseases we think about now, but there are likely to be many more in the future. The system will display whether the user has the disease or not when the user enters some parameters related to the disease. Many people can benefit from this initiative as it allows them to monitor one's health status and take the necessary steps to prolong their life.
